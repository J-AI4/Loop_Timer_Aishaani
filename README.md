# Loop_Timer_Aishaani
Overview:

The Loop Timer lets users set a custom timer using hours, minutes, and seconds. You can choose how many times to repeat the timer. You can also see which loop is currently running.

Why I Made This:

I needed a loop timer, simple and clear to manage looped tasks (in my case, studying and workouts). Most of the websites I went through weren't appealing, and had too many things running on the sides and background. So I bult my own. 

How It Works:

The Loop Timer was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can select the duration for each loop (hours, minutes and seconds), choose how many loops you want, get notified with a small tune after each loop. It shows progress like: Loop 1 of 2 -> Loop 2 of 2 -> All loops completed! and also shows how much time is left per loop. 

How to Run:

1. Download all the files (index.html, style.css, script.js, audio.mp3)
2. Open index.html in your desired browser
3. Try it out!

Notes:

This was built completely by me, although I did get some help with debugging through VSCode. Let me know if you have suggestions for new updates, I'm all ears!
